# Manual-test plan — pimote

Primary user journeys for the pimote PWA + server. This is the persistent
list — each autoflow topic's manual-test run smokes this suite plus
whatever the topic adds on top.

"Primary" = high-value happy path a real user walks, the kind of
regression we do not ship. Edge cases and branch exploration live in the
per-topic artifacts under `docs/manual-tests/<topic>.md`, not here.

Every journey names a **driver**: an automated tool under
`tools/manual-test/` (or elsewhere, e.g. `scripts/`) when one exists, or
**manual-browser** when the journey requires a human clicking the PWA.
Journeys that have no automation yet are still listed — they remain
items that must be exercised each run even if only by a human.

## Journeys

### 1. Connect and open a session

**What:** PWA connects to the pimote server; the **dashboard** (the landing
surface since the `project-management` topic removed the sidebar) lists
discovered folders (`list_folders` windows over a connection-owned pinned
order, with code and persona rows over the sparse folder model), the user starts a new session from a folder row (or
creates/resumes one), session metadata appears in the active-session bar, and
closing the viewed session returns to the dashboard. Sessions may also open
and list in cwds outside the scanned folders: the server serves a synthetic
classified folder row for them (the `classifyFolder` fallback) without
listing or curating the cwd.

**Why:** Entry point for every other journey. If this breaks, everything
breaks.

**Driver:** `tools/manual-test/project-management-smoke/` drives the dashboard
half end-to-end (render, new session, resume of a fabricated session, back
navigation, active-session dot); the prompt/streaming half remains
manual-browser plus journey 2's drivers.

### 2. Prompt → streamed assistant response

**What:** User types a prompt in a session; the server routes to pi;
assistant message streams back live (markdown renders progressively,
with fenced code highlighting WHILE it streams; tool calls render with
their args/results). Tool-call visualization is specialized: `edit`
calls render as live per-edit diffs, and `write` calls render via
`CodeBlock` — syntax-highlighted code for code paths, live
rendered markdown for `.md`/`.markdown` paths, each with a raw-source
copy button and a show-more/collapse wrapper. `agent_end` leaves the
session idle. Prompt _composition_ includes TUI-style `@`-file-path
autocomplete: typing `@` (anywhere in the line) opens an `fd`-backed
file/dir suggestion menu; picking a file inserts `@path`, picking a
directory inserts `@path/` and keeps the menu open to drill in; quoted
`@"…"` tokens cover paths with spaces; the literal `@path` text is sent
unchanged (no server-side expansion) and stays mutually exclusive with
the `/` slash menu.

**Why:** The product's core loop. Correctness + latency here is the
primary UX.

**Driver:** manual-browser for the live-streaming half;
`tools/manual-test/streaming-code-highlight-smoke/` drives the settled
state of the `write`-tool / markdown render path (mode routing,
raw-source copy in both modes, collapse in both modes, code
highlighting, markdown rendering). The streaming-only behaviors
(auto-expand/collapse, mid-stream highlight in the write view) remain
manual-browser / unit-tested — a disk-fabricated harness can't drive a
live token stream. `tools/manual-test/at-file-syntax-smoke/` drives the
`@`-file-path autocomplete composition path end-to-end (the
`complete_file_refs` endpoint + the real InputBar dropdown, file/dir
insertion, mid-line trigger, slash mutual-exclusivity, and the
`fd`-missing one-time warning).

### 3. Extension UI bridge

**What:** pi extensions call `ui.select` / `ui.confirm` / `ui.input` /
`ui.editor`; the PWA renders the dialog (inline for select/confirm,
modal for input/editor), the user answers, the extension receives the
value.

**Why:** Extensions are a first-class pimote feature; the bridge is the
only way they can ask the user anything.

**Driver:** manual-browser (against a test extension that invokes each
dialog type).

### 4. Shared session observers

**What:** Two clients open the same session. Both receive the live
transcript and live bash output, and either client can send a prompt.
Each sender's optimistic entry settles exactly once: its stamped echo
replaces it, and a `queued` or `handled` outcome (a `/`-command, a
steer into an active run) removes it, so later turns append at the
bottom on every client (DR-076). Disconnecting one client leaves the
other attached. A client that returns after the slot was reaped and
reopened by the other client (or after a server restart) gets a full
resync, not an empty replay (DR-077). A dialog the other client answered
while one was offline is gone after reconnect. Archiving closes all
observers with `session_closed { reason: 'archived' }`; unarchiving
leaves the session closed until an explicit open.

**Why:** Shared observers let several devices watch and control one live
session without takeover races.

**Driver:** `tools/manual-test/session-observers-smoke/` (transcript/send
fan-out, dialog resolution, archive/restore, voice holder) plus
manual-browser for the optimistic-entry and reaped-slot reconnect checks
(two browsers or profiles with distinct client IDs; a duplicated tab must
take a fresh client ID).

### 5. Slash commands and tree navigation

**What:** `/new`, `/reload`, `/tree` intercepted by the client /
server. `/tree` opens the tree-navigation dialog; selection dispatches
`navigate_tree`; the session resyncs to the picked branch.

**Why:** Tree navigation is the user's handle on pi's branch model.

**Driver:** manual-browser.

### 6. Panel cards from extensions

**What:** An extension pushes cards via `@pimote/sdk` detect; the
PWA's side panel (desktop) / overlay (mobile) renders them; updates
from the extension re-render; session switch swaps panel contents.

**Why:** Panels are how extensions surface structured state.

**Driver:** manual-browser (with a panel-emitting test extension).

### 7. Push notifications

**What:** User opts in to notifications; server sends Web Push on
interaction events (extension dialog prompts); the browser fires the
notification; clicking it focuses the relevant session.

**Why:** Off-screen notifications are the primary mechanism that makes
pimote usable as a phone client.

**Driver:** manual-browser (PWA + real browser-side push).

### 8. Voice call — bind, in-call, hangup

**What:** On a session, the user starts a call (mobile: via the
`Voice call` row in the session-details dialog; desktop: via the
inline `Start voice call` button in the status bar); `call_bind` round-
trips; a full-screen **calling-mode** surface replaces the chat with
three regions — header (project label + duration + mic state +
listening / thinking / speaking pulse), read-only transcript, and a
bottom gesture zone with three gestures: **swipe up = hang up**, **tap
= mute toggle (with audio cue)**, **swipe down = abort current run
(with audio cue, call stays connected)**. On call end (hangup,
server-side end, displacement, or network drop) calling mode auto-
returns to the normal chat surface for the same session. While a call
is active, extension UI bridge dialogs reject with
`ui_bridge_disabled_in_voice_mode`. Displacement of the voice call
holder surfaces `call_ended { reason: 'displaced' }` to the old client. There
is no `CallBanner` strip and no inline phone button in the mobile
header — calling mode is the only in-call UI.

**Why:** The voice modality (v1) added in the `voice-mode` topic.
Covers the pimote-side seam — the real WebRTC / STT / TTS path lives
in speechmux and is exercised separately.

**Driver:**

- `scripts/voice-mock-smoke.mjs` (mock-speechmux, orchestrator +
  extension-runtime layer) for server-side behaviour.
- `agent-browser` skill for the PWA UI — Call button renders, click
  emits `call_bind`, full-screen calling-mode surface mounts (header +
  read-only transcript + bottom gesture zone), the three gestures
  (tap=mute, swipe-up=hangup, swipe-down=abort) drive their respective
  actions, and hangup tears down back to the chat surface. Real-
  speechmux end-to-end is blocked on speechmux-repo work; see
  `docs/manual-tests/voice-call-fullscreen-ui.md` for the current
  `agent-browser`-driven run.

### 9. Android — Assistant-callable Pimote projects

**What:** Pimote projects are voice-callable via Google Assistant
("Hey Google, call <project>" or "Hey Google, call Pimote") and
tappable from the system contact card. Boot the Android app, ensure
`READ_CONTACTS` / `WRITE_CONTACTS` are granted, and wait ~2 s for
the contact + shortcut sync debounce.

1. From the system Contacts app, locate a Pimote project contact,
   open its card, confirm the call action button is present, tap it,
   and observe the call dispatching through `PimoteConnectionService`
   (the in-app `InCallActivity` opens).
2. Say `"Hey Google, call Pimote"`. Confirm the fallback shortcut
   resolves to the most-recently-active project and the call
   dispatches.
3. Say `"Hey Google, call <project name>"` for one of the top-N
   projects (within the system shortcut cap). Confirm direct
   resolution dispatches.
4. Say `"Hey Google, call <utterance close to a project name>"`
   (small mispronunciation / partial match). Confirm fuzzy-match
   resolution dispatches.
5. Confirm long-tail projects beyond the system shortcut cap are
   still callable from the contact-card surface (repeat step 1
   against an off-list project).

**Why:** This journey is the integration test for the
`android-assistant-callable-projects` topic. The unit tests cover
`ContactsSync` / `ShortcutsSync` purely; nothing on the JVM exercises
`TelecomManager`, `ShortcutManagerCompat`, or Assistant
fulfillment — those need a physical device.

**Driver:** manual on a physical Android device (no automation).

### 10. Interactive provider login (`/login`)

**What:** Typing `/login` in the InputBar opens the global LoginDialog
(no prompt is sent to the agent). The provider picker lists the OAuth
subscription providers (Anthropic Claude Pro/Max, GitHub Copilot,
ChatGPT/Codex) from `getOAuthProviders`, marking logged-in status.
Picking a paste-back provider (Anthropic/OpenAI) renders an "Open auth
page" link **and** a working paste field simultaneously (the link must
survive pi's immediately-following manual-code prompt step). Picking a
device-code provider (Copilot) renders the user code + verification
link. Cancel closes the dialog cleanly; a second login attempt while one
is in-flight is rejected as busy. On a successful login the model picker
re-pulls so new provider models appear.

**Why:** This is the only way to add an interactive-OAuth model provider
to a running pimote deployment from the client — without it, a remote
operator must SSH in and hand-edit `auth.json`. Added by the
`provider-login` topic.

**Driver:** `tools/manual-test/provider-login-smoke/` drives the flow
end-to-end via `agent-browser` + a direct WS probe for the busy guard,
up to the auth-URL / device-code / paste step. Completing a real token
exchange is environment-bounded (needs real subscription credentials);
the terminal success + model re-pull are covered by the server + client
unit suites.

### 11. File offer → native download / session inbox

**What:** In a PWA session, an agent offers a file. The user sees one
actionable toast for the exact offered item, can dismiss it into the viewed
session's Downloads inbox, and clicks a native same-origin attachment link.
The browser receives the live file once; the source remains on the server,
and a second redemption is unavailable. Pending sibling files are scoped to
their owning session, survive reconnect/reopen, and restore silently without a
duplicate toast. A background notification opens/adopts the owning session's
overview/inbox intent without following the one-shot URL.

**Why:** This is the PWA's user-approved file-transfer path. The offer,
one-shot capability, session-local fallback, and recovery semantics are
load-bearing; a regression either loses the file or causes an unsolicited/
stale action.

**Driver:** `tools/manual-test/file-downloads-smoke/` drives the real server,
HTTP route, WebSocket state, and PWA via `agent-browser`. The harness uses a
sandbox-only pi extension to synthesize the typed offer event in lieu of a live
LLM/tool turn. Focused/background push planning and inbox-adoption contracts
are covered by the client unit tests; OS Web Push delivery remains
environment-bounded in headless Chromium.

## 12. Dashboard: folders, hubs, and manager

**What:** The dashboard is the product home (the `project-management`
topic): the folders list accumulates pinned windows and renders a bounded
virtualized range. Scroll fetches continuation windows under the adopted token.
Search matches folders and session text server-side, including unfetched rows.
Discovery is sparse with no depth bound (nested entries under skipped wrappers
surface at any depth; included folders stop descent). Rows carry a
code/persona nature icon in
four variants (code, code-hub, persona, persona-hub by nature ×
shortcutCount), favorites, archive/show-archived, inline expansion of
per-folder sessions loaded only for rendered rows, and repo status chips
(branch + dirty dot) from plain-row `repo` facts and hub-member `repos`; the hub dialog composes a hub folder from indexed repos (server
creates the symlink hub + `git init` + `.gitignore` + generated `AGENTS.md`)
and membership edits reshape it; the New Session dialog hosts the four-kind creation
wizard (kind icon row above the folder picker; identity → members? →
skippable text step; every flow ends in `open_session` in the new folder; code
kinds seed `AGENTS.md`, persona kinds seed persona-marker `AGENTS.md` +
`memory.md`, hub kinds seed member symlinks and nature-worded link lines in
the `AGENTS.md` managed block); hub rows manage members ("Manage members…":
add/remove as hub-side symlinks plus exact seeded `AGENTS.md` lines; the
member folder is never touched) and every row archives/restores ("Archive
project" / "Restore project": folder curation only, session records never
archive); epoch-stamped `folders_changed` deltas merge `changed`
rows and drop `removedPaths` in both clients. Archived-row probes explicitly
set `includeArchived`. Fresh discovery comparisons explicitly repin. Folder sources contribute repo/hub entries (missing ones
provision via `onFolderOpen` at open time); the manager is a persisted
persona folder at `managerRoot` (default `~/.local/state/pimote/manager`,
boot-seeded with a persona-marker `AGENTS.md` + `memory.md`, user files
never overwritten; a manager root that is or contains home fails boot with
guidance). The dashboard text box opens or continues ordinary persisted
manager sessions: submission creates a session on the ordinary
conversation surface, old sessions resume behind the `Previous sessions`
click and across full server restarts, a disconnect keeps runs processing
server-side, and reconnect replays from the client's cursor. The
manager-exclusive pimote toolset (`pimote_find_folders`,
`pimote_create_folder`, `pimote_update_folder`, `pimote_update_hub_members`, …)
answers over real server APIs; `pimote_create_folder` publishes new persona
folders via `folders_changed`. Manager folder listings remain complete,
unwindowed reads with curation, membership, and git facts on each row.

**Why:** This replaced the sidebar as the primary navigation surface; hubs
are the multi-repo model; the manager is the dashboard's second half.

**Driver:** `tools/manual-test/project-management-smoke/` (real sandboxed
server + `agent-browser` + a second WebSocket probe client, including the
four-kind creation wizard, hub member add/remove with `FolderInfo.members`
deltas, folder archive/restore, the
unscanned-cwd session fallback and legacy `multiRepo` registry read-compat
probes);
`tools/manual-test/manager-tools-smoke/` drives the manager toolset
deterministically (registration + execution against real ports, no LLM) to
backstop the LLM-dependent tool-choice assertions in the chat phase;
`tools/manual-test/manager-lifecycle-smoke/` drives the manager persona-root
boot lifecycle at the wire level (seeding and user-file preservation,
placement guard, nested-root listing exclusion, persisted manager sessions
across a full server restart, disconnect-mid-run with cursor replay — no
browser or LLM); `tools/manual-test/folder-paging-smoke/` drives the windowed-listing
behaviors at scale over a ~250-row fixture — window continuity under deep
scroll (including curation edits mid-scroll), two-tier server search with
`matchedSessionIds` narrowing and debounced typing bursts, `folders_changed`
delta delivery (curation, hub create, file_put, discovery
additions), refresh/reconnect cache-replace, the archive toggle × session
lists interplay, and rendered-row-only session loading.

## 13. AGENTS.md editor

**What:** The home-page "Agent instructions" button opens the config-file
editor dialog on `~/.pi/agent/AGENTS.md` — raw markdown editor with a tag-wrap
toolbar (freeform tag input + `tagSnippets` snippet buttons), save
(last-write-wins), and cancel with a discard confirmation. The same editor is
folder-scoped through three controls: FolderList's row-menu "Edit AGENTS.md…"
opens the selected folder's instructions; StatusBar's "Edit folder AGENTS.md"
and SessionDetailsDialog's "Edit AGENTS.md" open the viewed session folder's
instructions. The editor's header selector switches between `AGENTS.md` and
`AGENTS.override.md` in that folder, confirming before discarding unsaved edits.
A missing file is created on save. Pi uses the override instead of the normal
instructions in the same folder. The session controls disable editing when
disconnected, without a folder, restoring, or pending; the details dialog closes
before the editor opens. The global Folders-header pen stays on the user-level
Agent instructions.

**Why:** The first-class config-editing surface (first citizen of the future
server-configuration workflow), added by the `agents-md-editor` topic.

**Driver:** `tools/manual-test/agents-md-editor-smoke/` (sandboxed pimote +
`agent-browser`). The three folder-scoped controls are pinned by the client
unit suite (`FolderInstructionsControls.test.ts`); selector behavior is covered
by `ConfigFileEditor.test.ts` and `file-editor.svelte.test.ts`. Their
journey-level clicks stay manual-browser.

## Automation gap (recorded, not an action item for this topic)

Journeys 2–7 currently have no automation driver of their own. This is a
deliberate pre-existing gap; journey 8 was first to pick one up
(`agent-browser` skill as of Re-test 2026-04-21), and the `project-management`
topic gave journey 1 (dashboard half) and new journey 12 full drivers. As
autoflow topics add user-facing features, this plan gets the new primary
journey and — when the topic brings automation along with it — the driver.
Journey 8 is the first journey to combine a server-side automated driver with
a UI-automation driver.
